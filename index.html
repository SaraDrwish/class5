            <p class="parag"> A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve.[1] People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.

            A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which is an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value.</p>
